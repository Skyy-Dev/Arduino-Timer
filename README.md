[WIP] Personal Arduino timer project

(Alternative application which can be used in tandem with the Arduino https://github.com/Skyy-Dev/Windows-app-Arduino-timer)

Premise:
This project was created mostly for my own personal use in quickly being able to set an alarm for food, however I thought I would try and take this personal need and turn it into an opportunity to learn!

Arduino set up:
 - Arduino Mega 2560
 - Serial Port: COM3
